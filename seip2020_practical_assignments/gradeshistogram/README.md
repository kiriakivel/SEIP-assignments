# Histogram of Grades

## About the Module

This program receives a .txt file as command line input, with grades represented as integer values.
Then calculates the frequency with which each of the grades appears and draws a line chart (histogram) as output.

The diagram is created using [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/).

## Execution Instructions

After you have followed the installation [instructions](https://github.com/kiriakivel/SEIP-assignments/blob/master/README.md), go to your terminal and make sure it points to `gradeshistogram/target` directory.

Then execute: `java -jar gradeshistogram-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar (name-of-input-file).txt`

Make sure that the .txt file containing the grades is in the same directory you're working.
